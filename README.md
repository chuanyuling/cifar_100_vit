# Vision Transformer Classification Project

This project applies the Vision Transformer (ViT) model to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. It includes scripts for training the ViT model, evaluating its performance, and preprocessing the data. The project is structured to be modular and easy to understand, with separate directories for datasets, models, utilities, and configuration.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, you need to have Python 3.x installed along with the pip package manager. Additionally, it's recommended to create a virtual environment for the project:

```bash
python -m venv my_project_env
my_project_env\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
source my_project_env/bin/activate  # On Unix or MacOS
```

### Installation

To set up the project environment and install the required dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chuanyuling/cifar_100_vit.git
cd my_project
```

2. Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Here's how to use the different scripts in the project:

### Training the Model

Run the training script:

```bash
python train.py
```

You can adjust training parameters like batch size, learning rate, etc., in `config.py`.

### Evaluating the Model

To evaluate the trained model on the test dataset:

```bash
python evaluate.py
```

The script will automatically load the model weights from the last epoch of training and provide you with the accuracy metrics.

### Working with Data

The `datasets/` directory should contain all scripts related to data download, preprocessing, and possibly the dataset files themselves if they are not too large.

## Project Structure

Here's a brief overview of the project's directories and files:

- `datasets/`: Includes scripts for data download and preprocessing.
- `models/`: Contains the class definition of the Vision Transformer model.
- `utils/`: Functions for data loading, normalization, augmentation, and dataset splitting.
- `train.py`: The script that fine-tunes the Vision Transformer model.
- `evaluate.py`: Code for evaluating the model's performance on the test set.
- `config.py`: Configuration file with settings such as paths, hyperparameters, and device settings.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all dependencies for easy installation.
